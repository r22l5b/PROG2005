Submission Via Blackboard. You will need to submit your code for tasks in Parts 1 and 
2 of the assessment by writing your code in TypeScript and Angular. For 
more details, please read the submission instructions below.
Unit Learning 
Outcomes 
This assessment task maps to the following ULOs: 
• ULO1: contrast mobile device architectures, interfaces, operating 
systems, and common middleware technology 
• ULO2: apply user-centred techniques to create application 
interfaces 
• ULO4: analyse and explain privacy and security requirements 
specific to mobile applications 
Rationale 
This assessment is crafted to deepen your understanding of TypeScript and Angular by engaging you 
in the development of applications that are relevant to Web and mobile systems programming. It 
serves as a practical opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, enhancing 
your skills in creating user-centred interfaces and addressing privacy and security considerations in 
mobile and Web app development. Through this hands-on experience, you're expected to become 
proficient in these modern programming frameworks, setting a solid foundation for more advanced 
topics and projects in the field. The assessment will be further improved and extended in Assessment 
3. 
Task Description 
Part 2 can be an expansion of Part 1. In this assessment, you are tasked with creating standalone 
applications using TypeScript and Angular, showcasing your grasp of these technologies. Your 
challenge is to develop a basic app for an art gallery in TypeScript (Part 1) and then extend or recreate 
this app using Angular (Part 2). Your applications should function without server-side interaction and 
maintain data structures for persistent user interactions within a session. This project not only tests 
your technical skills but also your ability to apply user-centred design principles in creating intuitive 
application interfaces. Though you can start again from scratch if you wish, it is recommended that 
you save your Part 1 before you start modifying it for Part 2. For lesser marks, you can divide your 
PROG2005 Assessment 2 
assessment into several smaller HTML pages to demonstrate the different aspects without having 
everything working together. This is not the preferred method. 
Task Instructions 
Part 1 – Basic TypeScript App 
• Objective: Create a TypeScript-based inventory management system that helps manage a 
simple database of items. The app should function while the browser is open, with no 
requirement for data persistence after closing the browser.
• Initialisation: Start with either hardcoded data or an empty structure. Use TypeScript 
effectively, ensuring appropriate type definitions for parameters and return values.
• Data Fields: The system should store: Item ID (Unique), Item Name, Category (Electronics, 
Furniture, Clothing, Tools, Miscellaneous), Quantity, Price , Supplier Name, Stock Status (In 
Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock), Featured Item (Yes, No), Special Note. All fields, except 'Special 
Note,' require values. An Item ID can only be entered and saved once (it must be unique for 
each item).
• Features:
o Add, edit, and update item details. Update should be done using item name.
o Delete item with confirmation prompts using item name.
o Search functionality based on item name.
o Display all items in the database.
o Display all featured items in the database.
o Responsive design, ensuring usability on both narrow and wide mobile screens.
o Implement interactive elements (use innerHTML assignments instead of alert() calls).
o Use CSS styles for basic styling and improve the user experience.
• Requirements:
o Implement a structured data model (TypeScript array of objects/interfaces) that 
maintains data integrity through type enforcement.
o Focus on TypeScript functionality, using minimal HTML form elements.
o TypeScript typing is necessary for parameters and return values, though function 
types may be inferred.
o Ensure well-structured, clean, and commented code. Submit Part 1 in a separate 
directory to avoid penalties.
o Use data validation while performing the operations on the recorded data.
Part 2 – Basic Angular App 
• Objective: Extend or recreate the TypeScript app as a multi-page Angular application. The app 
should incorporate features for managing books and authors efficiently.
• Pages: The Angular app should contain at least five pages, including:
o A homepage displaying the purpose of the app.
o A page for adding and editing books and authors.
o A book search page with filtering options.
o A privacy and security analysis page explaining key security considerations.
PROG2005 Assessment 2 
o A help page with FAQs and troubleshooting guidance.
• Features:
o Add, edit, and update item details. Update should be done using item name.
o Delete item with confirmation prompts using item name.
o Search functionality based on item name.
o Display all items in the database.
o Display all featured items in the database.
o A dedicated page that presents text explaining these privacy and security 
requirements.
• Code Structure:
o Maintain modular, commented, and well-organized code.
o Submit Part 2 separately to ensure clarity and organization.
• Requirement:
o Your Angular app must include at least one module and one component, but 
additional components should be created to implement necessary functionalities.
o Ensure the app is user-friendly, responsive, functional, and validates all inputs (e.g., 
numeric fields should not accept letters).
If you are experiencing personal or/and difficult situations, you must apply for a Special Consideration 
(see the link below) and inform your tutor before the due date to be considered. Unless an extension 
is approved, there is a late submission penalty.

Task Submission 
You are required to submit your source code for both parts of the assessment as a single ZIP archive. 
Please upload this ZIP file to the designated submission link on the unit site. For TypeScript, ensure 
that you include TS files. If the file size exceeds the upload limit, please send the ZIP file via email or 
through a method specified by your tutor.
Ensure that your source code is well-structured and adequately commented, as you will be penalized 
for poorly structured or uncommented code. Each source code file submitted must include title 
comments identifying the author and the assignment part. Additionally, please organize the separate 
parts of the assignment into separate subdirectories (e.g., Part 1, Part 2, etc.). Failure to follow this 
instruction may result in penalties.
PROG2005 Assessment 2 
Please note that this assignment is due after the weekly modules have covered all required 
materials. It is advisable not to leave this assignment until the last minute; you can begin working on 
it while the concepts are fresh in your mind. You may start Part 1 before completing the study of all 
required materials. If you need an extension, you must apply to your tutor before the due date. Late 
submissions without an approved extension will incur penalties.
Academic Integrity 
At Southern Cross University, academic integrity means behaving with the values of honesty, fairness, 
trustworthiness, courage, responsibility and respect in relation to academic work. 
The Southern Cross University Academic Integrity Framework aims to develop a holistic, systematic 
and consistent approach to addressing academic integrity across the entire University. For more 
information, see: SCU Academic Integrity Framework
NOTE: Academic Integrity breaches include unacceptable use of generative artificial intelligence 
(GenAI) tools, the use of GenAI has not been appropriately acknowledged or is beyond the acceptable 
limit as defined in the Assessment, poor referencing, not identifying direct quotations correctly, close 
paraphrasing, plagiarism, recycling, misrepresentation, collusion, cheating, contract cheating, 
fabricating information. 
At SCU the use of GenAI tools is acceptable, unless it is beyond the acceptable limit as defined in the 
Assessment Item by the Unit Assessor. 
GenAI may not be used
Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, for completing the assessment 
tasks is prohibited. You only can take guidance from GenAI tools, e.g., you can find relevant examples
or use for troubleshooting purpose only. You are required to demonstrate if you have developed the 
unit’s skills and knowledge. If you use GenAI tools to generate the code and you fail to demonstrate 
the required skills in your assessment task, it may result in an academic integrity breach against you 
as described in the Student Academic and Non-Academic Misconduct Rules, Section 3.
This assessment, which is to be completed individually, is your chance to gain an understanding of the 
fundamental concepts of TypeScript and Angular on which later learning will be based. It is important 
that you master these concepts yourself. 
Since you are mastering fundamental skills, you are permitted to work from the examples in the 
MySCU site or study guide, but you must acknowledge assistance from other textbooks, classmates, 
or online resources. In particular, you must not use online material or help from others, as this would 
prevent you from mastering these concepts.
